# PowerShellServer
 Spawn a powershell intrance, redirect stdout/stdin to a listen socket


Simple program used for a specific use case I had.

Spawns and powershell instance (either within the process, or as a child process as per preprocessor defines set at compile time), and
exposes it the the network.
